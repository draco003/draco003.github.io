[Mind mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map "Mind Map") is something robust, it helps in visualizing what’s in your mind on a piece of paper, you don’t need lots of papers and paragraphs to scroll down to infinity in order to  describe a project or a task that  is made up of multiple sub-tasks, this is where the mind map comes in.

Center your main topic, or project title in the middle of the paper and start branching up every simple detail of the other sub-tasks. However complex it’s made up of simple fragments right? 

As a proud Linux user I got my self the [Freeplane](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page "Freeplane download") mind mapping  software, it’s amazing. There are other ones out there but I like this one. it’s simple, robust, can export to multiple formats, and makes the whole process very easy.

Here is a simple example ilustrating the [PADI](http://www.padi.com/scuba/ "PADI") Boat Diver specialty using Freeplane.
