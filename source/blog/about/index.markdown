Welcome to my personal journal.

I'm an undergraduate engineer, opensource programmer, writer, diver, cyclist, and an animal rescue responder.

This journal will document my projects, code mods, tips and hacks on UNIX(BSD) and Linux systems.

I'll be writing on networking, security, programming, databases, and anything related to web development and system administration.

I'll also write about Embedded Systems, including ATMEL AVR MCUs, and ARM Processors.

Enjoy your stay.
